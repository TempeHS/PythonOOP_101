# Python OOP Fundamentals

## 1. Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. An Object is an instances of a class, created using the class definition.

## 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of hiding an object's implementation details from the outside world and only exposing the necessary information through public methods.
Encapsulation helps protect the object's internal state from external interference and misuse.
In Python, you can achieve encapsulation using private attributes and methods, denoted by a double underscore prefix (__).

## 3. Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, called the superclass or parent class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class.
The child class inherits all the fields and methods of the parent class and can also add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.
Inheritance promotes code reuse and helps create a hierarchical structure.

## 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
It enables you to write generic code that can work with objects of multiple types, as long as they share a common interface.
A common way to achieve polymorphism is method overriding.
Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

## 5. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding unnecessary details.
Abstraction helps to simplify complex systems and focus on the essential features.
In Python, you can achieve abstraction using abstract base classes (ABC) and abstract methods.
